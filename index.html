                A blockchain is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger that records transactions across a
                network of computers in a secure and transparent manner. It is a foundational technology underlying
                cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but its applications extend far beyond digital currencies. The concept of
                a blockchain was introduced by an unknown person or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008
                as part of the Bitcoin whitepaper.

                A blockchain is a distributed, immutable, and decentralized ledger at its core that consists of a chain
                of blocks and each block contains a set of data. The blocks are linked together using cryptographic
                techniques and form a chronological chain of information.

                Blockchain technology achieves decentralized security and trust in several ways. To begin with, new
                blocks are always stored linearly and chronologically. That is, they are always added to the “end” of
                the blockchain. After a block has been added to the end of the blockchain, previous blocks cannot be
                changed.
